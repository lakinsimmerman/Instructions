Importance of Proper Communication 

I can still remember the look I gave my mom as she purchased the most beautiful tv stand for our living room. 
It was a wooden piece painted black with multiple glass doors shinning brightly down below.  
I could not quite see the actual stand yet due to it still being in the wrapings, but from the picture of it, I knew it was extravagant. 

As we got home, I was eagar to begin putting it together to reveil the masterpiece of work that it was. 
I ripped open the box that the contenets were in, pulled out the instructions and *gasp* the instructions were in spanish!
There were no english instructions anywhere to be found. 

Upon only receiving spanish instructions, I knew my only option was to use the graphics that were provided with the foreign words. 
After many hours (more than needed if in correct language) I finally completed the tv stand. 
If given correct instructions, it would have been a much simplier process. 
However, it just goes to show, we are capable of doing things without proper instruction as long as we are willing to use a little brain power and are determinded to get the job done.
